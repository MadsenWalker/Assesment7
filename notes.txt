Results are below, it appears that the insert method will be more efficient only in the extra large array. The append method starts larger but scales on a steady axis, the insert method starts smaller but scales exponentially. The insert method doesn't scale as well as it should because of the unshift method. As the amount of indexes in the array gets higher, it starts adding more and more run time to (un)shift all the indexes down, vs just appending them to the end.
